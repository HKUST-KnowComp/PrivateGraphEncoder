Source Code for CIKM2023 paper "Independent Distribution Regularization for Private Graph Embedding"

## Introduction
We propose an independent regularization for private graph representation learning to protect graph embeddings against attribute inference attacks. The framework learns two graph autoencoders and forces the independence constraint.
